# DGIM 2530 – Simon Assignment

For your version of Simon, all of the following **6 modifications** are **REQUIRED**:

- Replace the stencil on the splash scene, along with the stencil color animation, with text that moves, rotates, scales, or otherwise performs interesting animation. Also consider adding audio to the splash scene.
- Replace `tone1.mp3` through `tone4.mp3` with your own sounds generated in GarageBand, Audacity, Chiptone, or other resources. See the instructor's in-class example for “swapping” audio and image resources.
- Modify the colors, images, and layout of the badge element in the main scene.
- Change the text and background colors on the main scene, as well as the font families and text position.
- Perform two usability tests with two different people. See the usability sheet provided below.
- Host the result on GitHub using the procedure provided.

Additionally, choose at least **2 of the following 6 optional modifications**. Feel free to add more if time permits:

- Add audio to the main page for when the page loads. Consider the “charge” theme or something similar.
- Modify and replace the 4 color PNG files with your own creation (`blue.png`, `red.png`, `green.png`, and `yellow.png`). Keep the same dimensions.
- Add an image or text to the middle section of the Simon stencil in the main scene which flashes, scales, rotates, or otherwise changes.
- Add code to handle the special case when the score reaches 100.
- Add code to display a timer for each game, showing how many seconds the player has been playing the game.
- Add other code, audio, and/or graphic resources not mentioned above.

## Usability Section

For the usability section, please perform each survey with just yourself and the user. Try to get individuals from different backgrounds in terms of age, gender, gaming interest, cultural background, etc. After the user is done, please add your own observations at the bottom of the survey regarding the users' reactions, as well as your own suggestions to improve how the game works based on the users' feedback. Save the document as `Usability-Survey-Simon-STUDENT-USER.docx`, replacing `STUDENT` with your name and `USER` with the name of the person taking the survey.

Be prepared to present your version to the class in two weeks, as well as your usability results. Upload the following files to D2L:

- The customized Hype file.
- The compressed HTML folder containing the game.
- Two completed usability test forms.

Also, make sure to include the GitHub URL in the comments.
